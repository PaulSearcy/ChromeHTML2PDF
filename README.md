# ChromeHTML2PDF
Is a basic demo demonstrating the usage of Docker, Typescript, JS, Express.js and Chrome. To take a snapshot of a website based on input URL and return it as PDF directly downloading it for user.

## Why
Project is a demonstration of understanding in regards to the fundamentals of:
- Typescript being a superset of Javascript and type usage
- Node and basic routing using Express
- Docker, Bash, and Linux

## Note
Styling was intentionally omitted to focus more on the back-end components this time around and to start on another related demo. CSS is very important to any application and I fully intend to come back to this to experiment more with Grid.
